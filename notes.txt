I've had to set up my config for macbooks way too many times
time to write down the proccess

My essential files are my vimrc, bash aliases, and bashrc, git config and tmux (5)

start by getting tmux to work
splitting screens and what not

next get the aliases to work, do this by doing a source on the alias file on bash_profile no rc file
copy the gitprompt.sh and git-completion.bash file to the home dir
and then copy over the ps1 propmt


## Setting up for vault

* Changed everything to bash and life is good again
* Drop `bash_profile`, with needed files
  * `bash_aliases`
  * `git-prompt.sh`
  * `git-completion.bash`

and the `PS1` value for better terminal prompt

* `brew install tmux`
* Copy `vimrc` and color theme `Papercolor`
* Install Vundle and do `PluginInstall`

* DONE

* Last but not least some colors in iterm profile
  * Background white, Foreground black
  * Uncheck Brighten bold text
